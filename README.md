# US Presidents Web Application

## Week 6 Group Homework

###Jason Caldwell, Rosanne Ussery, Alex Perez


With this project, our group worked together to create an informational website for users to explore information about the US presidents in a slide show format. 

Our goal was to  display a web page with information about a president. We were directed to create a website where a user should be able to click next and previous buttons to scroll through the presidents in order. They should also be able to jump to a particular president by entering in their term number.

We were to include the name, image, term number, party, and dates in office as well as an interesting piece of data about the president.

Challenges:
Our greatest challenge was getting the backend coding correct to allow the servlet to pull information from the .txt file and work with the JSP to display the information.

Future goals:
Our future goals are to:
* Create a more attractive presentation of the information. 
* Allow the user to choose to see a filtered list of presidents (for example, only the republicans).
